# FreeBSD Raspbery Pi Image Builder #

This builder creates pre-prepared SD cards for the Raspbery PI, based on the official Debian build provided by the Raspbery PI foundation. However it also includes several customisations, aimed at supporting the use of the Raspbery PI within the Networking Labs, at the Department of Computing at Sheffield Hallam University.

**Note:** This means this build is *not* suitable as a general-use/media machine. We don't have any graphical interfaces or other applications you will find in other builds. If you are not interested in something that might fall under the title "embedded router", please try [something else][http://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads].

# Contributing to pi-bake #
 
* Check out the latest master to make sure the feature hasn't been
  implemented or the bug hasn't been fixed yet
* Check out the issue tracker to make sure someone already hasn't
  requested it and/or contributed it
* Fork the project
* Start a feature/bugfix branch
* Commit and push until you are happy with your contribution
* Make sure to add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it
  in a future version unintentionally.
* Please try not to mess with the Rakefile, version, or history. If you
  want to have your own version, or is otherwise necessary, that is
fine, but please isolate to its own commit so I can cherry-pick around
it.
